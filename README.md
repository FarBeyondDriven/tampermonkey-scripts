Collection of useful Tampermonkey Scripts

## killBadEvents
- Blocks "bad" browser events, for example the hijacking of the "contextmenu" event to prevent you from right-clicking anywhere on the webpage or replacing the context menu with something else.
- `https://github.com/FarBeyondDriven/tampermonkey-scripts/raw/main/killBadEvents.user.js`

## TwitchLooter
- Automatically claiming twitch drops from the stream page (and automatically reload the page to start the next drop)
- Automatically claiming channel points
- Automatically confirming mature streams
- `https://github.com/FarBeyondDriven/tampermonkey-scripts/raw/main/TwitchLooter.user.js`

*Note: On streams with lots of viewers (5k+) twitch sometimes fails to deliver the drop notification, can't click a notification that never shows up...*
